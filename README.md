# Final for INFOTC 1000
### This is an assignment created and completed by _Mason Adrales_

This assignment is meant to explain a little about me; Mason Adrales. I first provide an [About Me](AboutMe.md) page that explains who I am and what I do. Then, I provided pages explaining [my time at Mizzou](MasonatMizzou.md), [my interests outside of school](OutsideofSchool.md), and [what I plan to do after school](AfterSchool.md). I hope you enjoy my final project!
