# After School
---
After school, my plans are to get a job in the Information Technology and live my life out in either Kansas City or whichever city I get offers from.
I look forward to learning more and more about new technologies as well as expanding on the topics I already know. 
Currently, I look to get a position in **Networking or Security**. I linked the company that I interned with below.
