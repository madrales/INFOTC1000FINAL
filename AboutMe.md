My name is Mason Adrales and I am 19 years old. I am an Information Technology major at the University of Missouri-Columbia. I am in my second year at Mizzou. I enjoy playing soccer, basketball, and both board games and video games. My favorite soccer club is Juventus from Turin Italy and I watch their matches every time I can. I also work for the University of Missouri in the Division of IT. I work as a Support Specialist in the Computing Sites sector.
