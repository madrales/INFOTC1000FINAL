I want to thank Dr. Dale Musser for teaching me important concepts that I will carry with me throughout my career. I learned how to use Git, Github, C#, Python, and a diverse mix of technology-related topics. I also want to thank the Teaching Assistants for being available frequently or explaining when and where they can meet. Overall, I think this class was a step as I've taken 1040 and 2040 already but it was necessary as important beginner concepts were explained. I enjoyed the class.

**Congratulations!** You have finished my final project. [Click here to go back to the home page.](README.md)
