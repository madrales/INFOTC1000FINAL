# Outside of School
---
[Go back](README.md)

Outside of school I spend my time being active. I really enjoy playing soccer, tennis, and basketball. I also spend time watching the NBA, Champions League, and any other kind of soccer that is on. I play FIFA on my Xbox quite a bit as well as games on my computer such as Overwatch, Minecraft, and Team Fortress 2. Spending time with my friends is also a preferred past time.
