My major is Information Technology. I have taken multiple courses in the program, mostly with Dr. Dale Musser. I have enjoyed the flexibility that the online courses offer but do enjoy taking classes in person. I have made the Dean's Honor Roll both semesters I have been here as well, showing my academic success in my courses. Overall, I hope to graduate a semester eary; December 2021. Here is a code block that I wrote in my INFOTC 2040 class:

```
ï»¿using System;

namespace CSharpBasics
{
    class Requirements
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            const byte sample1 = 0x3A;
            byte sample2 = 58;
            int heartRate = 85, choice = 2;
            double deposits = 135002796, distance = 129.763001;
            const float acceleration = 9.800F;
            float mass = 14.6F;
            bool lost = true, expensive = true;
            const char integral = '\u222B';
            const String greeting = "Hello";
            String name = "Karen";

            if (sample1 == sample2)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("The samples are equal.");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("The samples are not equal.");
            }

            if (heartRate >= 40 && heartRate <= 80)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Heart rate is normal.");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Heart rate is not normal.");
            }

            if (deposits >= 100000000)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("You are exceedingly wealthy.");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Sorry you are so poor.");
            }

            double force = mass * acceleration;
            Console.WriteLine("Force = " + force.ToString("#.000"));

            Console.WriteLine(distance + "is the distance.");

            if (lost == true && expensive == true)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("I am really sorry! I will get the manager.");
            }
            if (lost == true && expensive == false)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Here is coupon for 10% off.");
            }

            switch (choice)
            {
                case 1:
                    Console.WriteLine("You chose 1.");
                    break;
                case 2:
                    Console.WriteLine("You chose 2.");
                    break;
                case 3:
                    Console.WriteLine("You chose 3.");
                    break;
            }

            Console.WriteLine(integral + "is an integral.");
            for (int i = 5; i <= 10; i++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("i = " + i);
            }

            int age = 0;
            while (age < 6)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("age = " + age);
                age++;
            }
            Console.WriteLine(greeting + " " + name);
        }
    }
}
