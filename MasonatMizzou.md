My major is Information Technology. I have taken multiple courses in the program, mostly with Dr. Dale Musser. I have enjoyed the flexibility that the online courses offer but do enjoy taking classes in person. I have made the Dean's Honor Roll both semesters I have been here as well, showing my academic success in my courses. Overall, I hope to graduate a semester eary; December 2021.
